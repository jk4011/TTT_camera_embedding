# Experiment Queue

Pending experiments, in priority order. NVS small config = L6/d256/p16, 30k
iters, bs16, ~1.6h per run on one B200. GPU 3 is free while ccv occupies 0-2
(until ~2026-07-09); cheap NVS items can run there anytime.

## Q1. Absolute-adaptation probe  [DONE 2026-07-07 -> F23: 21.634 vs base 21.745 (within noise); PRA-relative isolates +1.34 dB]
Requested 2026-07-07 (paper Sec "What stays absolute" support).
- Design: full TTT-RoPE recipe, but replace every token's phase coordinates
  pi with ONE random 6-vector drawn per scene (same for all tokens in the
  scene; resampled every scene, train and eval). All relative rotations
  become identity; only the absolute stamps vary across scenes. Raymap
  INPUT features stay the true rays (only the rotary phases are randomized).
- Compare: (a) baseline no-rotary, (b) this variant, (c) full PRA.
- Reading: (b) vs (a) measures how well slow weights absorb pure absolute
  phase variation (benign-residue claim: expect (b) ~= (a), no collapse);
  (c) - (b) isolates the purely relative part of the gain. Complements F12
  (h_dpra: cancelling the rotated init readout HURT -0.59).
- Cost: 2 new runs (b is new; a, c exist) = ~3.2h on GPU 3. Implementation:
  one flag in lact_nvs (cam_phase_override=scene_random), seed-stable per
  scene id.

## Q2. Deeper fast weights: one rotary per address space at depth 3  [RUNNING 2026-07-07 GPU 3: run_q2_chain.sh, fw3l_base -> fw3l_rot2 -> fw3l_rot3, 30k each + eval]
Requested 2026-07-07 (Method "Generalization to other fast weights" claim).
- Design: replace the SwiGLU fast weight with a 3-layer inner network
  (e.g., W3' silu-gate stack or plain W_out sigma(W_mid sigma(W_in x))) in
  the NVS small config; sites = input, hidden1, hidden2. Runs:
  (a) 3L baseline no rotary, (b) 3L + 2 rotaries (input + last hidden),
  (c) 3L + 3 rotaries (all address spaces).
- Reading: does the third interface earn its rotation ("one rotary per
  address space")? Watch inner-loop stability (LaCT weight-norm on the
  middle matrix; may need lr retune) - ViT3's insight 5 says deep inner
  models are fragile, our stabilizers may be the difference.
- Cost: 3-4 runs x ~2h (deeper inner model is slower). After Q1.
- Note: also the theory check for the ViTTT Stage-1 plan (hidden-site
  creation), see chat 2026-07-06.

## Done / superseded
- Q3 (ViT3 Stage-1, TTT-RoPE on plain ViT3-T): DROPPED per user decision 2026-07-07 (ImageNet download not worth it; NVS/video/LLM evidence sufficient for the paper).
- v20k long-budget video ablation -> F22 (h-PRA exactly neutral at 20k).
- ccv 3-run grid (base/pra/both) RUNNING on GPUs 0-2 since 2026-07-07.

## Q5. ccv_pra_fixed: clean TTT-RoPE video run (fixed ladders)  [FRONT OF QUEUE; auto-launches on GPU 3 when Q2 seeds finish]
Requested 2026-07-07. Same as ccv_pra but ttt_learnable_freqs OFF: zero added params,
pure fixed-ladder TTT-RoPE vs cam_encoder. 20k steps, ~46h. Deterministic noise is
per-step, so paired comparison vs ccv_base/pra/both stays valid despite later start.
Config: abl_ccv_pra_fixed.yaml; launcher run_ccv_pra_fixed.sh; log /tmp/ccv_pra_fixed.log.

## Q4. Rigorous 3-seed ablation at best fixed-ladder setting  [RESCHEDULED: runs on first GPU freed by ccv completion (~2026-07-08 night); GPU-3 slot given to Q5]
Requested 2026-07-07. No learnable frequencies; matched ladders (input F=21, hidden F_h=42).
- Runs (seeds 95/137/211): full = pra_h_hi (qk_rope+h_pra); w/o input = h_pra_hi (new config,
  F_h42 only); w/o hidden = pra_hi (F21 only). Baseline (no PE) 3 seeds already exist.
- Reuse: pra_h_hi s95 (22.836/0.2690), pra_hi s95 (22.389/0.2753) => 7 new runs (~7h).
- Deliverable: mean +- std table for the paper's main ablation.
